## Background
CatchTheEggs! is a 2D console game where a player controls a frying pan and must catch eggs falling from the sky. The player uses left and right arrow keys to slide the pan across the ground. Golden eggs are worth more points than white eggs. The game ends when 5 eggs touch the floor.

The main features of this game are:

* Users are able to move their 'character' using left and right arrow keys
